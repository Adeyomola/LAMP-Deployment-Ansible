- Here's an ansible playbook for deploying a LAMP server and setting up PostgresQL on Ubuntu and Debian distros.
- It was created using ansible roles.

- It goes without saying but defining passwords and other sensitive information in plain text is not the best way to go. Instead, create encrypted variables or variable files with ansible vault.
